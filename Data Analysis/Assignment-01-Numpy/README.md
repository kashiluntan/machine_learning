The goal of this challenge is to get familiar with the Numpy library, manipulate multidimensional arrays and apply some linear algebra operations without using `for` loops.

There is no `make` for this challenge as all will happen in the Notebook. You will get visual confirmation of the correct answer by looking at the output below the cell.

In your terminal, please run:

```bash
jupyter notebook Challenge.ipynb
```

Have fun!
